I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I am so fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/jun-wang(6d556e00-9da5-4b40-9602-8ee68ce4e526).html) (IEEE Life Fellow, IAPR Fellow, Member of Academia Europaea). I obtained my B.E. degree in automation from Northeastern University in 2020.

I work on optimization algorithms, neural networks, computational intelligence techniques, and clustering methods. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing collaborative neurodynamic optimization approaches to capacitated clustering and collaborative annealing clustering methods.
